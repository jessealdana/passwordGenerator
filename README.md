# passwordGenerator
This program creates a random password based on parameters chosen by the user.  So far it is able to collect a random string of user desigated length, however it does not return the desired characters - it returns their index.  The string is recorded in the console log but it is not returned through the website's outbox.

This program now returns a password of the length specified by the user and made up from the character sets selected by the user from a predetermined list.  I made several iterations of this program that were non-functional and I deleted much of that code.  It was only after my classmate, Vinnie Lopez, talked me through the process in a zoom session that I was able to present the completed project.
